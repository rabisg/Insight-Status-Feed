This module integrates Twitter and Identi.ca into Insight.
The use cases for the same have been outlined here
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Insight_use_cases_for_status_and_microblogging
Sections:
   I'm interested in @Fedora status messages
   I work on Fedora social networking, and I want to reply to a user.



How-to Use this module

1. On Insight website this module should work out of the box because '@fedora'
is the default search keyword. However one can always change the search term at
the Configuration page(admin/config/services/insight_status_feeds) to suit their
need.

2. This module creates menu entries
  feed/ : For twitter Updates
  feed/identica : For Identi.ca Updates

3. For Twitter feeds this module uses Web-Intents (https://dev.twitter.com/docs/intents)
to provide reply/favorite/retweet links and conforms to Twittter's Display guidelines
(https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-guidelines).

3. Since identica doesn't have a built-in Intent system like Twitter this module currently
relies on identica module for direct integration with Identi.ca services
If identica module is enabled and the user has an assocaited Identi.ca account then additional
links for repeating,favouriting and replying are displayed that makes ajax requests to the
desired services.


Known Issue

The identi.ca logo displayed below the notices are external web url's. For more information
see the .module file (function insight_identica_feed_create_identica_page())
We have to find an elegant way of doing this or at least host the image as a part of our service
to remove external dependency.
